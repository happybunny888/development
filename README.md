### Goal and Value of the Application
The app is for purchasing tickets to see movies at a drive in theater (since this is mandated to be single page, removed/did not consider time or scheduling for this app). Users can see what films are offered, their descriptions, prices, ratings, see the poster. Users can sort by ticket price for the film or by the ratings. Users can also filter by Movie Type/Genre: (currently for this demo only three categories) Anime, Action, or Romance. 

### Usability Principles Considered
Status of system is clearly present: sort and filters cause the movies to show up in different order or their presence is immediate after selecting sort/filters. Increasing or decreasing amount of tickets per movie will be indicated in the aggregator: film x number is made immediately clear with the price.

All elements, options, and options are visible in the app. No short forms are used, headings/labels are present, the reset and clear cart buttons are clear and in their respective areas.
